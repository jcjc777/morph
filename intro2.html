          <p id="ind">Since 3D designing covers a few categories, the focus of this site is on 3D modeling and printing;
          the creation of an object which has 3 dimensions (height, width, depth) in a virtual environment with the goal 
          of having it printed (as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_rendering">3D Rendering</a>.)
          While the technology had been around for more than 30 years, it had only been used for broad applications
          within the past decade. It's advancement as a big consumer technology had somehow stagnated but it is evolving 
          to include a wide range of professional enterprise applications across various industries, like aerospace, 
          automotive, medical, retail, military/defense, and other professional services. The growth of industrial
          applications for 3D modeling and printing are projected to be about 18% per year over the next 5 years.</p>

          Most of these services have more than one physical printing locations and a presence in the New York metro area. 
          These services vary in the printing material they specialized in, prices and printing requirements. The notable ones that are popular

          <p id="ind">A 3D printer is a machine allowing the creation of a physical object from a three-dimensional digital model, 
          typically by laying down many thin layers of a material in succession. While the technology has been around for a few decades,
          the development had not reach mass market until about 10 years ago. Since then with many news stories, advertisements and promotions,
          3D printers and printing had penetrated our common lexicon.</p>
          <p>The range of 3D printers varies based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing_processes">processes,</a> 
          and <a href="https://www.3dnatives.com/en/plastics-used-3d-printing110420174/working materials">working materials that differ in characteristics.</a> 
          They are further divided into types and technologies involved; and then the consumer or professional enterprise application marker segments.</p>
          <p>The recent 3D design growth and broader professional enterprise applications had prompted big players like 
          <a href="https://www.ge.com/reports/heart-heart-two-innovators-reveal-whats-next-3d-printing-healthcare/">GE</a> 
          and <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/printers/3d-printers.html">HP</a> to make rapid foray into the industry.
